# DESCRIPTION

A [Date::Holidays](https://metacpan.org/pod/Date%3A%3AHolidays) style package updated with the British bank holiday dates now
published at [https://www.gov.uk/bank-holidays](https://www.gov.uk/bank-holidays). Holidays may apply to all
regions, or some combination - see the `regions` parameter for more details.

N.B. - Dates of future holidays may occasionally be updated after they've been
published.

Module is named with correct ISO-3166-1 code for the United Kingdom: "GB"
(Great Britain)

To just work with holiday days for a single region, use one of the subclasses:
[Date::Holidays::GB::EAW](https://metacpan.org/pod/Date%3A%3AHolidays%3A%3AGB%3A%3AEAW), [Date::Holidays::GB::NIR](https://metacpan.org/pod/Date%3A%3AHolidays%3A%3AGB%3A%3ANIR), or
[Date::Holidays::GB::SCT](https://metacpan.org/pod/Date%3A%3AHolidays%3A%3AGB%3A%3ASCT).

# EXPORTS

Exports `holidays`, `is_holiday`, `next_holiday` on demand.
Also can export the aliases `gb_holidays`, `is_gb_holiday`
and `next_gb_holiday`.

# METHODS

Both `is_holiday` and `holidays` take either an argument list or hash of
named arguments.

The named arguments are `year`, `month`, `day`, and `region`. `region`
should be either omitted (to search all regions) or an arrayref of the UK
regions that you are interested in, as ISO-3166-2 codes.

The argument list should be in the following order: year, month, day, and
(optionally) regions.

Note that you will need to specify region(s) to make correct use of this
module - Bank Holidays are not the same throughout the UK!

## holidays

    # year, month, day, [regions]
    my $holidays = Date::Holidays::GB->holidays( @args );

or

    # ( year => ..., month => ..., day => ..., [ regions => \@. .. ] )
    my $holidays = Date::Holidays::GB->holidays( %args );

Returns hashref of holiday dates, values are a string listing the holiday(s)
taking place on that date, with the region name(s) in parenthesis.

Holidays that occur in all regions are returned with a single canonical name,
taken from the name in England & Wales.

Date keys are in the format MMDD, as per the behaviour of [Date::Holidays](https://metacpan.org/pod/Date%3A%3AHolidays).

## is\_holiday

    # year, month, day, [regions]
    my $holiday = Date::Holidays::GB->is_holiday( @args );

or

    # date in YYYY-MM-DD format
    # ( date => ..., [ regions => \@. .. ] )
    my $holiday = Date::Holidays::GB->is_holiday( %args );

or

    # ( year => ..., month => ..., day => ..., [ regions => \@. .. ] )
    my $holiday = Date::Holidays::GB->is_holiday( %args );

Returns the holiday details (as per `holidays`) but for a single date.
Returns false if the specified date is not a holiday in the appropriate
region(s).

## next\_holiday

    my $next_holiday = Date::Holidays::GB->next_holiday( @regions );

Returns the holiday details for the next holiday in the specified regions.
If no regions are specified, returns the next holiday dates for all regions.

The `all` key in the results is the next holiday observed by all regions.

## date\_generated

    print Date::Holidays::GB->date_generated;

Prints the date that the data was downloaded, in YYYY-MM-DD format.

# ISO-3166-2 REGION CODES

Valid codes for the regions that make up ISO-3166-1 "GB" are:

- EAW - England & Wales
- SCT - Scotland
- NIR - Northern Ireland

# GENERATING THE DATA

The source for this package is generated via a script, included with the
distribution (`share/generate_date_holidays_gb.pl`). This downloads the
latest JSON files from [http://www.gov.uk/](http://www.gov.uk/), and could be used to
update/alter the package if necessary.
